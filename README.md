# Passer-Game

The rules of the game are as follows. The game is played simultaneously by two players, each placing a marker of their own color into a cell that has not yet been occupied. When both players choose the same cell to mark, the Eater's marker remains and the Passer's marker is eliminated. Otherwise, the markers remain on the board until the game is completed.
   
From the top to the bottom, the Passer seeks to form a connected
path of its own markers, which can go down, left, right, down-left, and down-right, but
cannot return. Once a connected path has been established, the Passer wins. The game
then terminates. As long as the Passer does not have a connected path and the board is
full, the Eater wins.
